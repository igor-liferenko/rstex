In the following places pk fonts are handled. Maybe somewhere there you need to add working with absolute and relative paths.

This prohibited to use pk fonts:
dvipdfm-x/pkfont.c "As a workaround, we drop a suffix if it exists."

This prohibited to use scaled pk fonts:
dvipdfm-x/pdfdev.c "And the extension ".pfb" prohibits to call mktexpk with right"
